# CVML

This is a machine learning library built from OpenCV

Currently, it has only oen capbability, function approximation with neural network, in cvnn.h and cvnn.cpp

main.cpp is the example implementation of the library fro function approximation

The project and make files etc. are for main.cpp

The csv files are some example datasets that can be used to test the library for function approximation. 
They are from the bike sharing demand competition on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data
