# CVML

This is a machine learning library built from OpenCV

Currently, it has only one capability, function approximation with neural network, in cvnn.h and cvnn.cpp

Files

main.cpp is the example implementation of the library for function approximation

CVML.project is the codelite project file for compiling with codelite

CMakeLists.txt is for compiling with cmake

To compile with CMake, run cmake CMakeLists.txt and then make

The csv files are some example datasets that can be used to test the library for function approximation. 
They are from the bike sharing demand competition on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data
